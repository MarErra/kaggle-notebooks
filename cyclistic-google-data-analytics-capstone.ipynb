INTRODUCTION\n\nThis notebook is a Case Study of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics//). The objective of this study is to follow the steps of the data analysis process learned in the course through a real case. \n\n### 1.1 SCENARIO\n\nCyclistic is fictional bike-share company located in Chicago. \n\nThe director of marketing **believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships**. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diferently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\n\nInitial considerations to take into account:\n* Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n* Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.\n* Casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program.\n* Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.\n\n\n## 2. ASK\nThe goal is set: Design marketing strategies aimed to converting casual riders into annual members.<br>\nTo achieve it, first we need to solve the following questions:\n- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n\n\n## 3. PREPARE\nCyclistic’s historical trip data will be used to analyze and identify trends.\n\nThe company has 5824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Every time a bicycle is used, all the trip information is stored in the database, which groups trips by month and year.<br>\nThe information collected for each trip is as follows:\n- Trip identifier\n- Type of bicycle used\n- Time and date of trip start\n- Time and date of trip end\n- ID and name of start station\n- ID and name of end station\n- Latitude and longitude coordinates of start station\n- Latitude and longitude coordinates of end station\n- User type (member or casual)\n\n### 3.1: COLLECT DATA\n\nAll data has been obtained from the following source: [Divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). <br> (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable us to answer the business questions.
